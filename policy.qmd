# Data Insights with Excel {#sec-excel .unnumbered}

**Goal**: Use Excel to explore Imago LSOA-level data, identify spatial/statistical patterns, and prepare simple tables or charts that highlight hotspots or relationships with deprivation. This session focuses on sorting, filtering, ranking, grouping, and visualising patterns.

## Load the Imago Product (CSV/Excel File)

Open the product file (e.g., Heat, Pollution, SPF at LSOA level).

The imago dataproducts can be found [here](https://imago.ac.uk/data). Have a look!

![Here is what the raw PM 2.5 (MSOA-level) looks like.](/data/msoa_pm25_exceldemo_fig1.png)

**Check your data includes these key columns:**

-   MSOA Code (unique identifier) - "dt_zn_c"

-   pm2.5_mean

-   MSOA Name

Format the dataset as a Table `(Ctrl+T)` for easy filtering and formulas.

## Add Contextual Data (Optional)

To enrich your analysis, you may want to join additional datasets such as population figures, urban/rural classification, or health indicators.

Using `VLOOKUP` to join data:

`=VLOOKUP([@[LSOA Code]], ContextData!A:B, 2, FALSE)`

Using `XLOOKUP` (Excel 365):

`=XLOOKUP([@[LSOA Code]], ContextData!A:A, ContextData!B:B, "Not found")`

Tips for joining:

-   Ensure LSOA codes are formatted consistently (text, no leading/trailing spaces)
-   Use `TRIM()` to clean codes if needed: `= TRIM(A2)`
-   Check for mismatches using conditional formatting or `COUNTIF` or `EXACT`

## Explore Patterns Using Excel Tools

Filtering & Sorting

**To filter:**

-   Click the dropdown arrow in any column header

-   Select specific values, or use "Number Filters" for conditions like "Greater than" or "Top 10"

**To sort:**

-   Click the dropdown arrow → Sort A to Z (ascending) or Z to A (descending)

-   For multi-level sorts: Data tab → Sort → Add Level

**Try these explorations:**

-   Filter using a threshold to show the most deprived areas.

-   Sort by \`pm_2.5_mean\` to find highest/lowest MSOAs
