    "text": "Using Imago Data Products for Social Research & Policy\nJoin us for a hands-on introduction to using Imago: Data Service for Imagery data products that transform complex satellite imagery into useful and usable datasets for social science, health, and policy analysis. This workshop is designed for researchers, local authorities, NGOs, and anyone interested in applying imagery-derived evidence to neighbourhood-level challenges.\nThis session has been developed by the Imago team.\nThroughout the workshop, you’ll work with real datasets, explore patterns linked to deprivation, and create simple analyses and maps that you can take back into your own projects.\nWhether you’re completely new to satellite data, comfortable with geospatial tools, or mainly work in Excel, this training offers multiple entry points. By the end, you’ll be able to combine Imago data products with other widely used sources to address real social-policy questions.\nThe website is free to use and is licensed under the Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International. A compilation of this web course is hosted as a GitHub repository that you can access:\n\nAs an html website.\nAs a GitHub repository.",

    "section": "Data Types",
    "text": "Data Types\n\nGrayscale Rasters\nGrayscale raster data is a type of digital image representation that uses varying shades of gray to depict the intensity or brightness of a particular phenomenon at different locations. In grayscale images, pixel values typically range from 0 (black) to 255 (white), with intermediate values representing different levels of gray. These pixel values can represent continuous data, making grayscale rasters suitable for visualizing and analyzing phenomena where intensity or variation needs to be conveyed, such as medical X-rays, satellite nightlights data, or other scenarios where the focus is on quantifying the degree of a single attribute without using color.\nExample: Nightlights Data\nNightlights data can be represented as a grayscale raster, where darker areas indicate lower levels of artificial light, and lighter areas represent higher levels of artificial light. The pixel values may represent the radiance or luminance values of nighttime lights. Satellite-based nightlights data is used for various applications, such as monitoring urban development, assessing light pollution, and understanding human activity patterns at night.\n\n\nMultispectral Rasters\nMultispectral rasters are a type of digital image representation that incorporates multiple spectral bands or channels to capture a diverse range of information about a scene or phenomenon. In multispectral rasters, each channel represents a specific part of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as visible light, near-infrared, or thermal infrared. By combining these spectral bands, multispectral data provides a comprehensive view of the landscape, enabling analysis of various aspects like vegetation health, land use, or changes in urban and rural conditions. This type of raster data is commonly used in applications such as remote sensing, agriculture, and natural resource management, where a nuanced understanding of different attributes of the environment is essential.\nExample: Landsat Satellite Imagery\nLandsat satellite imagery, with its multispectral bands, is extensively used for environmental monitoring. It allows for tracking changes in land cover, assessing vegetation health, monitoring water quality, and detecting forest fires. Researchers and environmental agencies use multispectral data to make informed decisions regarding conservation and resource management.\n\n\nColor Rasters\nColour rasters are a digital image representation that utilizes the combination of three primary colour channels: red, green, and blue (RGB) to create a full range of colors. Each pixel in a colour raster is assigned values for these three color channels, which determine the pixel’s color.\nExample: Digital Photographs\nColuor rasters, as seen in digital photographs can be used for social sciences by analysing pixel differences.\n\n\nElevation Rasters\nElevation rasters are a type of digital representation that use a grid of values to depict the varying heights or elevations of the Earth’s surface across different locations. Each pixel in an elevation raster contains a numerical value representing the height or elevation above a reference point, such as sea level. Elevation rasters are commonly used in geospatial applications, cartography, and terrain modeling. They enable precise visualization and analysis of topographic features, such as mountains, valleys, and slopes, making them essential for tasks like mapmaking, land-use planning, flood risk assessment, and 3D visualization of landscapes.\nExample: Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)\nDEMs are vital for creating topographic maps, analyzing terrain, and conducting spatial modeling. They find applications in urban planning, flood risk assessment, route planning, and 3D visualization. DEMs enable precise representation of Earth’s surface elevation, supporting a wide range of geospatial applications.",

It’s an R wrapper for the exactextract package (written in C++). It’s more accurate than ArcGIS, QGIS, and Python’s rasterstats package in calculating zonal stats.\ntmap: quick and easy, and its “view” mode allows you to create interactive maps that are built on leaflet.\nggplot: the best package for building beautiful maps. Allows for more customisation than tmap.\n\nThere are also the following packages which we will not be using in this workshop:\n\nrgeedim: provides the easiest way to download data directly from Google Earth Engine as GeoTiffs.\nrgee: an R wrapper for Google Earth Engine, so you can run GEE commands in R\ngganimate: a package that allows you to turn your ggplot2 graphs into gifs.\nrayshader: create animated 3D graphs and maps in R.\ncountrycode: a useful package to automatically generate ISO codes from country names (and vice versa), assign continents to countries.\ndoparallel: my go-to package for parallel processing. ::: –!&gt;",

    "text": "Installing and loading Packages\nBefore you can use specialized packages for geospatial analysis and statistics, you need to install them (download and set them up on your system or runtime) and then load them (make their functions available in your current session). You only need to install a package once, but you must load it every time you start a new session.\n\n\nInstalling packages\nPython:\n# Using conda (preferred for local installations)\n# Run in terminal/command line:\nconda install geopandas rasterio xarray -c conda-forge\n\n# Using pip (in Colab or Jupyter notebooks)\n%pip install geopandas rasterio xarray pyfixest\n\n# Install specific version\n%pip install geopandas==0.14.0\nR:\n# Install from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"sf\")\ninstall.packages(c(\"terra\", \"exactextractr\", \"ggplot2\"))\n\n# Install from GitHub (development versions)\nremotes::install_github(\"r-spatial/sf\")\n\n# Install specific version\nremotes::install_version(\"sf\", version = \"1.0-14\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteInstallation in Colab\n\n\n\nIn Google Colab: - Python packages use %pip (magic command) to ensure installation in the correct environment - R packages use the standard install.packages() function - Many common packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) are pre-installed in Colab - For geospatial packages, you’ll typically need to install them at the start of your notebook\n\n\n\n\nLoading Packages\nPython:\n# Import packages\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport rasterio\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# You can also import specific functions\nfrom pyfixest.estimation import feols\nR:\n# Load packages\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(exactextractr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Alternative way to load packages\nrequire(dplyr)",
