# From grids to areas {#sec-satellites-areas .unnumbered}

# How hard is it to process satellite data?

-   Brief explanation of what raw satellite data looks like (spectral bands, huge files).

-   Short illustration/demo: raw image → cleaned image → aggregated product.

-   Emphasize that satellite data is not a ready-made map—significant processing steps are required.

# The Satellite Data Pipeline

-   Walk participants through the journey from orbit to neighbourhood-level metrics:

-   Capturing raw imagery (Sentinel, Landsat)

-   Atmospheric correction + cloud masking

-   Temporal compositing to reduce noise

-   Spatial aggregation to small geographic units such as LSOA/MSOA

Optional quick example: the difference between a pixel-level value vs. an aggregated area-level mean.

# Challenges in Raw Workflow

-   Highlight why most users cannot (or should not) work directly with raw satellite data:

-   Massive data volumes and file handling

-   Need for compute resources (e.g., cloud platforms)

-   Technical complexity of remote sensing algorithms

-   Difficulties linking pixel-based data to meaningful social units

-   Why pre-processed and validated data products save time and improve reliability

# Why Products Like Imago Simplify the Process

-   Pre-computed, ready-to-use LSOA-level statistics

-   No need to handle large imagery or complex algorithms

-   Clear benefit of small-area data: show a LSOA vs MSOA comparison map to illustrate how detail disappears at larger scales

-   Introduce the three products available (for Newcastle / region): Pollution, Heat, SPF

Explain how they align with deprivation and social vulnerability analyses

# Icebreaker questions:

-   What’s the biggest file you’ve ever worked with?

-   What steps in the satellite data pipeline do you think matter most for accuracy?

-   Where do you think errors or uncertainty might creep in?
